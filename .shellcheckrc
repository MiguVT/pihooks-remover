# Treat scripts as POSIX sh (not bash)
shell=sh

# Disable specific warnings that don't apply to Android environment

# SC1091: Not following sourced files (Android paths don't exist on build system)

# SC2034: Variable appears unused (we use some for documentation/future use)
# Note: Enable this during strict audits
# disable=SC2034

# SC2039: In POSIX sh, certain features are undefined
# We're careful about this, but Android's sh is usually mksh which supports more
# disable=SC2039

# We intentionally skip quoting in some cases for property patterns
# Note: Keep enabled, fix issues instead
# disable=SC2086

# Android's sh handles -a fine, but we'll use && for clarity anyway

# Android's echo supports -n and -e
disable=SC3037
